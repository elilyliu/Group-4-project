    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games have become a significant part of modern entertainment, with millions of players worldwide engaging in various gaming platforms. Understanding player behavior is crucial for game developers and researchers, as it helps optimize resources, improve user experience, and tailor marketing strategies. In this project, we analyze data from a Minecraft research server operated by a UBC Computer Science research group led by Frank Wood. The dataset records player characteristics and session details, providing insights into gaming habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our specific research question is: Can game experience, age, and gender predict whether a player is a high contributor (played more than 3 hours)? High contributors are valuable because they generate more gameplay data, which is essential for research purposes. By identifying factors that correlate with high playtime, the research team can better target recruitment efforts and allocate server resources efficiently.\n",

Classifying high contributors to be those who played for 3 or more hours, only 19 players in the dataset are considered to be high contributors with an average age of 19.8 years (Fig. 3). The Majority of players are low contributors (152). Because of these imbalances in data, when performing our classification prediction, it is necessary to scale the data."
